# c-binarytree
This is a program that is the conversion of my C++ project binary tree to c# code, the following code is mostly a trial and error approach by me.
It is supposed to allow a user to type "insert", "delete", "search", "list", and "reset" the binarytree. Then by following with a
string word in the next line with the insert, delete, and search commands, you the binary tree should add the string to the binarytree.
All words are arranged alphabetically with words appearing before other words being further left in the list, and words alphabetically larger appearing
further right on the list. The delete method should delete a string in the list while maintaining the alphabetical nature of the list.
Search will search for and if found print out a string input by the user. Reset should make the tree null. List should list all nodes in the list and their count.
"help" wil display these commands. 
The tree uses objects as its payload to support expansion of the "node" class to other projects in the furture.
NOTE* subcases of delete exist still that have not been fixed.
